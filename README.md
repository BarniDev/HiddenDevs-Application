# Hidden Devs Application

Welcome to my application repository for **Hidden Devs**! This project showcases my skills, system design approach, and problem-solving abilities as a developer.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains the files for my Melee weapon system, which I'd like to use to apply for the Scripter role in the Hidden Devs community.

Contains:
- A server side script (CombatSystem.lua)
- A client side module (Melee.lua)

- The codes are commented, and the client side module has 200+ lines of code without comments.
